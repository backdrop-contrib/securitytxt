* Introduction
The Security.txt module provides an implementation of the security.txt
draft RFC standard. It’s purpose is to provide a standardised way to
document your website’s security contact details and policy. This
allows users and security researchers to securely disclose security
vulnerabilities to you.

You can learn more from the [[https://securitytxt.org][security.txt website]] and [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-02][draft RFC]].
