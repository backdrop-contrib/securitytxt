Security.txt
============

The `securitytxt` module provides the [security.txt
standard](https://securitytxt.org/) for Backdrop CMS.

Its purpose is to provide a standardised way to document your
websiteâ€™s security contact details and policy. This allows people to
securely disclose vulnerabilities to you.

Requirements
------------

You must replace your `.htaccess` file with the one provided by this
module at `htaccess/modified.htaccess`. This will be required until a
fix for "[issue
5583](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/5583#issue-1200228154)"
has made its way into your version of backdrop.

**Note:** `htaccess/original.htaccess` is a copy of the default
`.htaccess` file from backdrop version 1.21.4 which
`modified.htaccess` is based on, it is only present for comparison
purposes.

Installation
------------

- Install this module in the usual way, see the [contributed
  modules](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/contributed-modules)
  of the user guide for details.

- Replace your `.htaccess` file with the one provided by this module
  at `htaccess/modified.htaccess`, e.g. `cp
  PATH_TO_CONTRIB_MODULES/securitytxt/htaccess/modified.htaccess
  PATH_TO_DOCUMENT_ROOT/.htacess`.
  
- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > System >
  Security.txt (`admin/config/system/securitytxt`) and enter the
  required information to create your security.txt file.

- Once you have created your security.txt file you should provide a
  signature for it by visiting Administration > Configuration > System >
  Sign (`admin/config/system/securitytxt/sign`) and following the
  instructions.
  
- Once you have completed all this configuration your security.txt
  and security.txt.sig files will be available at the following standard URLs:
  - `/.well-known/security.txt`
  - `/.well-known/security.txt.sig`
