  The Security.txt module provides an implementation of the security.txt
  draft RFC standard. It’s purpose is to provide a standardised way to
  document your website’s security contact details and policy. This
  allows users and security researchers to securely disclose security
  vulnerabilities to you.

  You can learn more from the [security.txt website] and [draft RFC].
